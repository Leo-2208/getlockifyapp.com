<h1>Privacy Policy for Lockify</h1>
<p class="date"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 23 January 2026</p>

<p>
Lockify is a privacy-first Android application designed to help users securely store and manage files on their device.
Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use the app.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
Lockify does not collect data automatically.
</p>

<p>
The app only processes information that you explicitly provide or choose to use within the app.
This includes:
</p>

<h3>a) Files You Choose to Import</h3>

<p>
When you import files (such as images, videos, PDFs, or other documents), those files are processed and stored locally
on your device inside the app’s private storage.
</p>

<p>
These files may contain personal or sensitive information depending on their content.
Lockify does not analyze or inspect the contents of your files beyond what is required to provide vault functionality.
</p>

<h3>b) Authentication and Access Control</h3>

<p>
Lockify uses the Android operating system’s secure authentication mechanisms to protect access to the vault.
</p>

<p>
Access to the vault always requires biometric authentication or the device’s screen lock credential
(such as fingerprint, face unlock, or device PIN, pattern, or password). This requirement applies in all modes of operation.
</p>

<p>
Lockify does not access, store, or process biometric data or device credentials.
All biometric and device authentication is handled entirely by the Android operating system.
Lockify only receives an authentication success or failure result.
</p>

<p>
If the user enables calculator stealth mode, an additional calculator-style PIN and gesture are required
before the system authentication prompt is shown. This calculator PIN acts as an extra access gate and
does not replace biometric or device credential authentication.
</p>

<p>
The calculator PIN is stored locally in a secure, cryptographically derived form and is used only to determine
whether to proceed to system authentication.
</p>

<p>
Lockify may present an alternate launcher icon and interface if the user enables stealth mode.
This does not affect how data is collected, stored, or shared.
</p>

<h3>c) Optional Profile Information</h3>

<p>
You may optionally set a profile name within the app.
This information is stored locally on your device and is used only for display within the app.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>

<p>
All data used by Lockify is stored locally on your device only.
</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Encrypted files you import into the vault</li>
    <li>File metadata (such as file name, size, type, and timestamps)</li>
    <li>Folder structure information</li>
    <li>Thumbnail images generated for preview purposes</li>
    <li>App settings and preferences (such as stealth mode status, warning confirmations, and review prompts)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lockify does not upload or synchronize this data to any external servers.
</p>

<h2>3. Thumbnails and File Previews</h2>

<p>
To display previews of files inside the vault, Lockify generates thumbnail images from files you import.
These thumbnails are stored locally within the app’s private storage and are not shared or transmitted.
</p>

<h2>4. Temporary Decrypted Files</h2>

<p>
Certain features may temporarily create decrypted copies of files on your device only, such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Viewing large files or PDFs</li>
    <li>Using the “Open with” or export feature to open a file in another app</li>
</ul>

<p>
These temporary files are stored in app-private locations and are intended to be removed automatically.
Once a file is opened in another app, Lockify cannot control how that external app handles the file.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>

<p>
Lockify does not share your data with third parties.
</p>

<p>
The app does not include analytics, advertising SDKs, tracking tools, or cloud services.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to export a file or open it with another app, that action is performed only at your request,
and data is shared directly with the app you select.
</p>

<h2>6. Internet and Network Usage</h2>

<p>
Lockify does not require internet access to function and does not communicate with external servers.
Your data remains on your device unless you explicitly export it.
</p>

<h2>7. Google Play In-App Review</h2>

<p>
Lockify may use Google Play’s official in-app review feature to allow users to rate the app.
This process is handled entirely by Google Play.
Lockify does not send any vault data or personal content to Google as part of this process.
</p>

<h2>8. What We Do Not Collect</h2>

<p>Lockify does not collect, store, or transmit:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Analytics or usage tracking data</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Contacts, messages, or call logs</li>
    <li>Device identifiers</li>
    <li>Raw biometric data</li>
    <li>Device screen lock credentials</li>
    <li>Cloud backups of vault data</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
Lockify is not directed toward children.
The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
All data stored in the app is user-provided and remains on the device.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in app features or legal requirements.
Any updates will be reflected on this page with a revised effective date.
